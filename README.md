# Chess in Open-GL

## Project Proposal
* The project proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z37KSzulZ_Y5sp6k8m_MwR439biY_9VneI7TwzkIz5g/edit?usp=sharing)

## About
“To develop a Multiplayer Chess Game using OpenGL and DevIL in C++ as well as implementing a Greedy algorithm for the CPU Player ”

* Project to be implemented using OPEN GL in C++
* Project is based on a 2-player Multiplayer game for chess.

## Frameworks used
* Open-GL 
* GLUT

## Features To Be Implemented
* Move Validation
* Class Implementation
* Position detection
* Score Update.

## Compiling and Running Open GL Programs
* Type in the following command to compile and run your file
```bash
g++ chess.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o chess
./chess
```

## Final Output:
* OpenGL game written in C++ which can be installed on any Operating System and be used accordingly.
* Open - GL using C++

## Rough Schedule:
* Week 1 - Implement the Chess Board
* Week 2 - Implement classes for the pieces and the way they move
* Week 3 - Fix bugs and pieces for a two player Chess game
* Week 4 - Implement Greedy Algorithm and allow User v/s CPU Matches
* Week 5 - Fix minor bugs and prepare project report.
